# PPUK v7 — Design System Rules (Cursor)

Source: docs/engineering/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

- Follow the defined layout:

  - Top nav, sidebar, main content, footer.

- Use the provided typography scale:

  - Page titles, section titles, card titles, labels, body, captions.

- Use the defined color system:

  - Primary, neutral, and semantic colors.

- Use components consistently:

  - Buttons → variants and sizes from the system.

  - Cards → title + content + actions, with consistent padding.

  - Tables → support sorting, filtering, and responsive behaviour.

- Forms:

  - Use labeled inputs.

  - Inline validation messages.

- Respect domain visuals:

  - Completion score → consistent visual representation (e.g., progress/circle).

  - Timeline events → icon + text + timestamp.

- Ensure all new components fit into this system; do NOT invent arbitrary styles.
