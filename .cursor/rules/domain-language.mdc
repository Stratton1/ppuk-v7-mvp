# PPUK v7 — Domain Language Rules (Cursor)

Source: docs/engineering/DOMAIN_LANGUAGE.md

Use these terms exactly, everywhere:

- "Property Passport"

- "Property"

- "Stakeholder"

- "Owner", "Buyer", "Tenant"

- "Viewer", "Editor"

- "Completion Score"

- "Document" (not "file" or "upload")

- "Media" (photos and videos)

- "Task"

- "Event"

- "Flag" (not "issue"/"problem")

- "Watchlist"

- "Public Passport"

Do NOT:

- Invent synonyms for these concepts.

- Shorten or rename them (e.g., "prop", "doc", "card", "home").

Button labels and headings MUST match the patterns from the design system and domain language docs.
