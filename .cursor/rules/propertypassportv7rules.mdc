# Property Passport UK v7 — Master Rule Index (STRICT)

This file connects Cursor's rule system to the modular engineering standards in `/docs/engineering`.

All other rule files under `.cursor/rules` refine these principles for specific areas.

## 1. Rule Sources

The canonical rule sources for this project are:

- docs/engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md

- docs/engineering/SUPABASE_STANDARDS.md

- docs/engineering/SERVER_ACTIONS.md

- docs/engineering/COMPONENT_GUIDELINES.md

- docs/engineering/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

- docs/engineering/TESTING_STANDARDS.md

- docs/engineering/AI_RULES.md

- docs/engineering/PERFORMANCE_GUIDELINES.md

- docs/engineering/DOMAIN_LANGUAGE.md

## 2. Applicable Sub-Rules

The following rule modules exist under `.cursor/rules`:

- architecture.mdc

- supabase-standards.mdc

- server-actions.mdc

- component-guidelines.mdc

- design-system.mdc

- testing-standards.mdc

- ai-rules.mdc

- performance-guidelines.mdc

- domain-language.mdc

Each module is mandatory. When Cursor edits code, it must comply with all relevant modules.

## 3. Priority

If there is a conflict:

1. Security & RLS rules win.

2. Supabase standards win over convenience.

3. Domain language & UX rules win over generic naming.

4. Performance rules win over naive implementation.

5. Testing rules win over speed of change.

## 4. Strictness

These rules are **STRICT**. Cursor must:

- Reject unsafe operations.

- Warn when a user request conflicts with the rules.

- Prefer minimal, compliant changes over large refactors.

- Defer schema changes unless explicitly instructed.

This file must be kept in sync with the engineering docs in `/docs/engineering`.
