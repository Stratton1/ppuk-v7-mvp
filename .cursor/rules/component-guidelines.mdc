# PPUK v7 — Component Guidelines (Cursor)

Source: docs/engineering/COMPONENT_GUIDELINES.md

- Default to **Server Components**. Use Client Components only for:

  - Forms

  - React Query data fetching

  - Interactive controls (dialogs, drawers, tabs)

- Use Shadcn UI primitives and TailwindCSS.

- Component organization:

  - `components/ui` → UI primitives.

  - `components/app` → app shell/layout components.

  - `components/property` → property domain components.

  - `components/dashboard` → dashboard domain components.

  - `components/public-passport` → public view components.

  - `components/admin` → admin components.

- Props:

  - No `any`.

  - Use explicit interfaces.

  - Mark optional props clearly (`?`) and provide sensible defaults where applicable.

- Every interactive element must have `data-testid` for testing.

- Include loading, empty, and error states for components that depend on data.
