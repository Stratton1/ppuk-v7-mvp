# UI Audit (Phase B — UI-only)\n\nScope: frontend UI components/pages; no auth, routing, Supabase, or server actions touched.\n\n## Findings by Area\n- Layouts & Shells\n  - `(app)` pages use `AppShell` + `AppSection`, generally consistent cards and headers. Padding is mostly uniform; hover shadows already standardized.\n  - `(public)` layout uses ad-hoc spacing; acceptable but could align with tokens for header/nav padding.\n- Empty States\n  - Watchlist, compare, admin analytics/dashboard have structured empty states with `data-testid`. Some legacy text-only empties remain in documents/media lists and related properties sections.\n  - Access patterns now have dedicated `AccessUnavailable`/`AccessDenied`, but not yet adopted everywhere (e.g., documents/media empties in property overview).\n- Typography & Spacing\n  - Headings generally use semantic `<h2>`/`<p>` with Tailwind classes; occasional inconsistent margins in marketing sections and card content.\n  - Spacing tokens (`p-4 sm:p-6`, `space-y-6`) mostly consistent via `AppSection`; marketing pages rely on custom spacing that matches design but isn’t token-referenced.\n- Buttons & Cards\n  - Buttons largely from shadcn; some links in marketing use plain `<a>` without button styling (OK for hero/CTA designs).\n  - Cards consistent on app shell; public pages use simple divs (acceptable) but could adopt card style for consistency.\n- Grids & Responsiveness\n  - Property compare table uses overflow handling; related properties grid uses simple cards—fine. Admin grids use sensible breakpoints.\n  - Marketing grids (logo cloud/personas) are consistent; minor opportunity to standardize gap sizes to tokens.\n- Components & Reuse\n  - Access components introduced for empty/forbidden states; should replace ad-hoc `<p>` empties across property overview cards and documents/media sections.\n  - No obvious duplicate components; legacy layout components remain unused and can be flagged later (outside current scope).\n\n## Risks / Gaps\n- Some empty states still plain text (documents/media previews, related properties).\n- Marketing/public layout not token-aligned; could drift from design system if styles evolve.\n- No visual regressions expected from current audit; future refactors should keep `data-testid` stable.\n\n## Recommended Quick Wins (UI-only)\n- Replace remaining text-only empties in property overview cards with `AccessUnavailable` for visual consistency.\n- Apply token-based spacing (`space-y-6`, `p-4 sm:p-6`) to marketing sections where margins differ.\n- Ensure headings in public sections follow typography scale from `styles/tokens.ts`.\n*** End Patch
