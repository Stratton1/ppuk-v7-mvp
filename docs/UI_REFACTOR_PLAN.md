# UI Refactor Plan (Phase B — UI-only)\n\nScope: Presentation only. Do not touch auth, routing, Supabase, server actions, or API routes.\n\n## Priorities\n1) Empty States & Access Components\n- Replace text-only empties in property overview (documents/media) and related properties with `AccessUnavailable` for consistency.\n- Keep `data-testid` stable for Playwright.\n\n2) Spacing & Tokens\n- Apply token-aligned spacing (`space-y-6`, `p-4 sm:p-6`) to marketing/public sections where custom gaps diverge.\n- Check typography scale matches `styles/tokens.ts` for headings/subtext.\n\n3) Cards & Buttons Consistency\n- Ensure cards use consistent border/shadow (`AppSection` style) where appropriate on app pages; keep public pages lightweight but aligned on padding.\n- Prefer shadcn Button/Link patterns for CTAs; keep semantic anchors for public marketing links where button styling is not intended.\n\n4) Documentation & Testing\n- Keep `UI_STATES.md` updated as access components are adopted.\n- Only adjust Playwright selectors if a swapped component changes a data-testid; avoid new flows.\n\n## Non-Goals / Safeguards\n- No changes to auth/login/register/reset flows.\n- No changes to `(app)/layout.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, proxy/middleware, Supabase clients, or server actions.\n- No backend or API modifications.\n\n## Suggested Execution Order\n1. Update remaining empty states on property overview cards and related sections.\n2. Normalize spacing on marketing sections using tokens; verify headings match design scale.\n3. Spot-check cards/buttons on key pages (dashboard, properties overview, public passport) for consistent padding/variants.\n4. Run a light visual sweep (no logic changes), update `UI_STATES.md` if new usages are added.\n*** End Patch
